## Session Leader(s)

- Cynthia Webster - PhD Student @ University of Connecticut

- Alex Hart - Research Assistant @ University of Connecticut

## Description

Introduction: 
- What is genome annotation? 
- Current challenges 
- Best practices
  - Introduction to functional annotation with EnTAP
  - Introduction to structural and functional annotation with EASEL

Running EnTAP as a standalone tool: 
- Installing dependencies
- Setting parameters and executing

Running EASEL: 
- Installing dependencies
- Setting parameters and executing

Annotating _Juglans cinerea_ with EASEL and EnTAP: 
- Evidence generation
- Gene prediction
- Secondary and primary feature filtering
- Evaluation
- Benchmarking against commonly used annotation tools

By the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Structurally annotate a eukaryotic genome assembly with protein and RNA extrinsic evidence using the EASEL nextflow pipeline, (2) Assess non-model structural genome annotations with comprehensive metrics that include providing functional annotation with EnTAP, (3) Address challenges with accuracy and efficiency with structural and functional genome annotation.
